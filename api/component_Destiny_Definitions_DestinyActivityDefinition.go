    // Challenges.
    //
    // An activity can have many Challenges, of which any subset of them may be active for play at any given period of time. This gives the information about the challenges and data that we use to understand when they're active and what rewards they provide. Sadly, at the moment there's no central definition for challenges: much like "Skulls" were in Destiny 1, these are defined on individual activities and there can be many duplicates/near duplicates across the Destiny 2 ecosystem. I have it in mind to centralize these in a future revision of the API, but we are out of time.
    Challenges []Destiny_Definitions_DestinyActivityChallengeDefinition `json:"challenges"`

    // DestinationHash.
    //
    // The hash identifier for the Destination on which this Activity is played. Use it to look up the DestinyDestinationDefinition for human readable info about the destination. A Destination can be thought of as a more specific location than a "Place". For instance, if the "Place" is Earth, the "Destination" would be a specific city or region on Earth.

    // Modifiers.

    // SelectionScreenDisplayProperties.

    GuidedGame any `json:"guidedGame"`

    // DisplayProperties.
    //
    // The title, subtitle, and icon for the activity. We do a little post-processing on this to try and account for Activities where the designers have left this data too minimal to determine what activity is actually being played.
    DisplayProperties any `json:"displayProperties"`

    // PlaylistItems.

    // Represents all of the possible activities that could be played in the Playlist, along with information that we can use to determine if they are active at the present time.
    PlaylistItems []Destiny_Definitions_DestinyActivityPlaylistItemDefinition `json:"playlistItems"`

    // ActivityTypeHash.
    //
    // The hash identifier for the Activity Type of this Activity. You may use it to look up the DestinyActivityTypeDefinition for human readable info, but be forewarned: Playlists and many PVP Map Activities will map to generic Activity Types. You'll have to use your knowledge of the Activity Mode being played to get more specific information about what the user is playing.

    // Rewards.
    //
    // The expected possible rewards for the activity. These rewards may or may not be accessible for an individual player based on their character state, the account state, and even the game's state overall. But it is a useful reference for possible rewards you can earn in the activity. These match up to rewards displayed when you hover over the Activity in the in-game Director, and often refer to Placeholder or "Dummy" items: items that tell you what you can earn in vague terms rather than what you'll specifically be earning (partly because the game doesn't even know what you'll earn specifically until you roll for it at the end)

    // The hash identifier for the "Place" on which this Activity is played. Use it to look up the DestinyPlaceDefinition for human readable info about the Place. A Place is the largest-scoped concept for location information. For instance, if the "Place" is Earth, the "Destination" would be a specific city or region on Earth.
    PlaceHash uint32 `json:"placeHash"`

    // PgcrImage.

    // When Activities are completed, we generate a "Post-Game Carnage Report", or PGCR, with details about what happened in that activity (how many kills someone got, which team won, etc...) We use this image as the background when displaying PGCR information, and often use it when we refer to the Activity in general.
