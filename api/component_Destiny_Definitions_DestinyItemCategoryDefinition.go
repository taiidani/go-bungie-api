    // Hash.

    Hash uint32 `json:"hash"`

    // ParentCategoryHashes.
    //

    // ShortTitle.
    //
    // A shortened version of the title. The reason why we have this is because the Armory in German had titles that were too long to display in our UI, so these were localized abbreviated versions of those categories. The property still exists today, even though the Armory doesn't exist for D2... yet.

    Visible bool `json:"visible"`

    // GrantDestinyItemType.
    //
    // If an item belongs to this category, it will also receive this item type. This is now how DestinyItemType is populated for items: it used to be an even jankier process, but that's a story that requires more alcohol.
